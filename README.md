# AI Demo - Movie Recommendation System üé¨

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a **collaborative filtering movie recommendation system** using Python and machine learning techniques. The project showcases proficiency in data science, machine learning, and recommendation system development through a practical, real-world application.

## üéØ Project Description

The Movie Recommendation System uses **item-based collaborative filtering** to suggest movies to users based on their historical ratings and the similarities between different movies. The system processes movie metadata and user ratings to generate personalized recommendations using cosine similarity calculations.

### Key Features

- **Similarity Computation**: Cosine similarity calculations between movies
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Item-based recommendation algorithm
- **Data Visualization**: Heatmaps showing item similarities
- **Model Evaluation**: Train/test split for validation
- **Real Recommendations**: Generates actual movie title recommendations for users

```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed with the following packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scipy jupyter
```

### Required Data Files

The project requires two CSV files (not included in the repository due to size):

1. **movies.csv** - Contains movie metadata with columns:
   - `movieId`: Unique movie identifier
   - `title`: Movie title with release year
   - `genres`: Pipe-separated list of movie genres

2. **ratings.csv** - Contains user ratings with columns:
   - `userId`: Unique user identifier
   - `movieId`: Movie identifier (links to movies.csv)
   - `rating`: User rating (typically 1-5 scale)
   - `timestamp`: Rating timestamp

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/comedianhhh/AI_Demo.git
   cd AI_Demo
   ```

2. **Add the required data files:**
   - Place `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv` in the project root directory
   - These files should follow the MovieLens dataset format

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MovieRecom.ipynb
   ```

4. **Execute the cells sequentially** to see the recommendation system in action

## üìä Implementation Highlights

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Loading**: Imports movie and ratings datasets using pandas
2. **Genre Encoding**: Creates one-hot encoding for 18 different movie genres
3. **Matrix Construction**: Builds user-item rating matrices for collaborative filtering
4. **Data Splitting**: Separates data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

### Recommendation Algorithm
1. **Similarity Calculation**: Computes cosine similarity between all movie pairs
2. **Prediction Generation**: Uses weighted averages of similar items for rating prediction
3. **Ranking System**: Sorts predictions to generate top-N recommendations
4. **Validation**: Tests recommendations on held-out user data

### Visualization and Analysis
- **Similarity Heatmaps**: Visual representation of item-item similarities
- **Data Exploration**: Statistical analysis of movies and ratings datasets
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation of recommendation quality

## üé¨ Sample Output

The system generates personalized movie recommendations such as:
